# Digital-Sudoku-Converter

This program was created using the Processing IDE. The aim of this project is to help users (primarily my dad) convert a printed, physical sudoku puzzle into a digital version. In order to do so, I have created a scripting technique, in which the user inputs the values in each row of the sudoku cell.

So, the user will have to input 9 lines, since the sudoku board has 9 rows. In each of the lines, there must be nine characters that are either numbers 1-9 or a dash to indicate an empty space
